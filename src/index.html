        Capture-The-Flags (better known as CTFs) are competitions where hackers have to solve
        cybersecurity problems (jeopardy style) and/or capture and defend computer systems
        (attack-defense style). These competitions consist of a series of challenges that vary in their
        degree of difficulty, and that require participants to exercise different skillsets to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Flags" are bits of data that prove you have completed a given task. Players can be lone wolves
        who attempt the various challenges by themselves, or they can work with others to attempt to
        score the highest number of points as a team. CTF events are usually timed, and the points are
        totaled once the time has expired. The winning player/team will be the one that secured the
        highest score.
